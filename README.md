# Solar Power Generation Prediction System 

This project focuses on predicting solar power generation using machine learning techniques based on historical data. The aim is to analyze patterns in solar energy production and build an accurate predictive model that can help in planning and optimizing energy usage.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains historical solar power generation data along with relevant environmental features. It was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

##  Machine Learning Models
Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared to determine the best-performing model. Model performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the most accurate model was finalized for predictions.

##  Project Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model building and comparison
- Final model selection
- User Interface creation using Streamlit
- Deployment of the prediction system

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
